# Tourism Console App
Important location finder
# Language: C

# Note:
    this is a simple console app that giving the user's location, tries to sort all near important places (such as restaurant, hotels, etc),
    by their distance from the person; the location data of the locations in the city can be fed to the program dynamically in the runtime;
    After the program sorts the location by distance from the user, 3 filtering options are given to the user to find the most appropriate place,
    considering the distance, price, quality and other factors, for him or herself
